    "In their fight against COVID-19, governments around the world have decided to close schools, universities, and other educational institutions as part of the largest shutdown ever recorded. They mainly intended to protect youth from exposure to the deadly virus as well as reducing its spread among the population. We shouldn’t overlook that these measures have many side effects including an unprecedented toll on children's education. The CovidMeasures Community is compiling information to help citizens better assess the pro's and con's of these measures as the crisis evolves.",

    "According to our count, 4/5th of the children population on the planet is (or has been) impacted by measures of the school closure. So far children have already been out of school for 1 month on average without knowing for how long. Recent announcements in some countries suggest that it may last until the summer.",

    "With the above ratios, we aim to capture the current magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the impacts of school closure measures on children education. We can notice large disparities between the continents. Nevertheless, a key takeaway is that the relative toll on education is relatively high. Therefore, governments should carefully evaluate the necessity any additional day of schools closure.",

    "To arrive at the ratios above, we compared the total number of school children affected by school closures to the number of active COVID-19 cases, and then to the number of deaths caused by COVID-19. The aim is to capture the current magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the impacts of school closure measures on children’s education. We can notice large disparities between the continents. Nevertheless, a key takeaway is that the relative toll on education is relatively high.
