  "aboutus_intro_1_p1": "Created by citizens for citizens, the CovidMeasures project tracks government measures and their implications on society.  We leverage the power of the crowd and reputable sources of information to shape an accurate view of the current measures around the world. On this website, we look to engage our visitors willing to share their knowledge, their experience and their views on this crisis. Don't be shy to contribute, we need your help to keep our content up-to-date.",
  "aboutus_intro_1_p2": "The project was born from an unsettling thought about the COVID-19 crisis. On the one hand, we are facing one of the most threatening health crisis of our generation. On the other hand, the government responses around the world led to probably the largest temporary restriction on citizens liberties ever recorded. We believe that citizens, especially those who suffer the most, shouldn’t be left behind. Experts, media, and government institutions have a big role to play guiding us through the COVID-19 crisis. But the citizens shouldn’t stop using their critical thinking and continue to judge for themselves on what is acceptable or not in the name of #flatteningthecurve.",
